# magicsquares
In recreational mathematics, a square array of numbers, usually positive integers, is called a magic 
square if the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are the same.
The order of the magic square is the number of integers along one side (n), and the constant sum is 
called the magic constant. See more info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square
